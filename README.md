## Code Review
HTML and CSS are getting easier for me, I've found very little challenges this time around. Before this project I struggled with @media queries because I didn't really understand it. After a short video I realised how easy they are. I realised all it is, is making new rules for when the website is a new screen width. I had a lot of fun playing around with it and testing new things. For my Hamburger Nav I just used a fontawesome icon for temporary use.
